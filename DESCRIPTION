Description: An adaptation of classical region/gene-based association analysis
    techniques that uses summary statistics (P values and effect sizes)
    and correlations between genetic variants as input. It is a tool to perform
    the most common and efficient gene-based tests on the results of genome-wide
    association (meta-)analyses without having the original genotypes and
    phenotypes at hand.
